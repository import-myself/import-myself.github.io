I am currently a first-year Master's student at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, under the supervision of Professor Xu Chen.\n 
My research focuses on LLM-based agents, exploring their applications and advancements in AI-driven systems. 
I earned my Bachelor's degree from the same institution, where I developed a strong foundation in artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n 
My academic interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing and intelligent agent design, with a focus on large language models and their real-world implementations.
